# Privacy Policy for Lyricar
_Last updated: May 17, 2025_

Lyricar ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Lyricar mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

Lyricar is designed to prioritize your privacy. We **do not collect any personally identifiable information** from users. Specifically:

- **No account registration is required**  
- **We do not access your contacts, photos, or files**  
- **We do not track your location**

To provide real-time lyrics synced with your music, the app requires access to:

- **Media Playback Information**: We access basic metadata such as the currently playing song's title, artist, and duration to display lyrics in sync.
- **Bluetooth Connection Data**: When using the app in a vehicle, we may detect active Bluetooth connections to enable automatic display of lyrics on your car’s infotainment system. This information is used locally and never transmitted or stored.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

All information is processed **locally** on your device. We use the data solely to:

- Synchronize lyrics with your currently playing music
- Display lyrics via Bluetooth on compatible car systems

We **do not** share, sell, or transmit your data to any third party.

## 3. Third-Party Services

Lyricar may integrate with third-party music apps (e.g., Apple Music, Spotify) via official APIs. These services may have their own privacy policies. We do not receive your login credentials or any personal information from them.

## 4. Data Security

Since we do not store any personal data or transmit user information externally, the risk of data breaches is minimal. All processing happens on your device.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

Lyricar does not knowingly collect any data from children under the age of 13. If you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App or on our official website.
